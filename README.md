# Creativity-and-Attitudes-in-Group-Conflicts
We investigated whether creativity is associated with the ability to overcome conflict-related biases in attitudes and to change attitudes in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We assessed creativity levels using the Torrance task of divergent thinking and measured group-based emotions and attitudes toward the conflict.
